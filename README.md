**User Stories:**

San Francisco is a colourful city, besides doing all the touristy things, there is a lot of art to be seen along the streets throughout the city. However, for the graffiti and mural lovers, there doesn’t exist a platform for them to find street art in San Francisco. We want to provide the platform for them to share their love. 

Graffiti is time-sensitive, sometimes we find a great graffiti on our way home, but when we come back a few days later, it’s gone or replaced by other graffiti, we want to keep these social memory forever and let others to explore their meanings and implications.

**Improvements on Usability and Acessbility:**
- Because it is a street art website with dark based Background picture, the button and words color we use is kind of bright but not messy.
- Change Authenticate to Sign in, change gariffti to Street Art, and change all font to be consistent for improving accessbility.
- Improve user accessibility using AXE DevTools.
